Projects were for internal clients. Sometimes the projects were built completely in house and other times they were customizations of 3rd Party software such as SalesForce and IBM’s Sterling OMS.

Functional Requirement Documents were created by BAs in conjunction with high level sketches.

B&H builds very complex apps. Illustrator and Photoshop Layer Comps couldn’t handle the complexity. HTML and Javascript took too long to account for scope and design changes. We evaluated numerous tools, including InVision and JustInMind, and settled on Axure. It handled most of what it was asked to do and became our go to tool.

JIRA was used for maintaining use cases. Skype, JoinMe and Slack were used for internal collaboration.

Some of the most interesting design problems I’ve faced have been during the last four years at B&H.
